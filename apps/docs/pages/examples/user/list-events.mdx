# List user events

Retrieves a list of "events" generated by the User on Vercel. Events are generated when the User performs a particular action, such as logging in, creating a deployment, and joining a Team (just to name a few). When the `teamId` parameter is supplied, then the events that are returned will be in relation to the Team that was specified.
